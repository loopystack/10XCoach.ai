# SSL Certificate Setup - Remove Browser Warning

To remove the "Your connection is not private" browser warning, you need to use a valid SSL certificate. The easiest way is to use **mkcert**, which creates locally-trusted certificates.

## Quick Setup with mkcert (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install mkcert

**Windows (with Chocolatey):**
```bash
choco install mkcert
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install mkcert
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install mkcert
# or
sudo yum install mkcert
```

### Step 2: Install the Local CA

This makes your browser trust certificates generated by mkcert:
```bash
mkcert -install
```

### Step 3: Create Certificates Directory

```bash
cd openAI_conver
mkdir certificates
```

### Step 4: Generate Certificates

```bash
cd certificates
mkcert localhost 95.216.225.37 127.0.0.1 0.0.0.0
```

This creates:
- `localhost+3.pem` (certificate)
- `localhost+3-key.pem` (private key)

### Step 5: Rename Files

Rename the files to match what the server expects:
```bash
# Windows PowerShell
Rename-Item localhost+3.pem localhost.pem
Rename-Item localhost+3-key.pem localhost-key.pem

# Linux/Mac
mv localhost+3.pem localhost.pem
mv localhost+3-key.pem localhost-key.pem
```

### Step 6: Restart the Server

The server will automatically detect and use these certificates. No browser warning! 🎉

## Alternative: Use Your Own Valid Certificates

If you have valid SSL certificates (from Let's Encrypt, Cloudflare, etc.), place them in the `certificates/` directory:

- `localhost-key.pem` (private key)
- `localhost.pem` (certificate)

Or use your server IP:
- `95.216.225.37-key.pem` (private key)
- `95.216.225.37.pem` (certificate)

## Verification

After setup, when you access `https://95.216.225.37:5000`, you should see:
- ✅ No browser warning
- ✅ Green padlock in the address bar
- ✅ Microphone access works perfectly

## Troubleshooting

**"mkcert command not found"**
- Make sure mkcert is installed and in your PATH
- Try restarting your terminal

**"Certificate not trusted"**
- Make sure you ran `mkcert -install`
- Try restarting your browser

**"Server still shows warning"**
- Make sure certificates are in the `certificates/` folder
- Check file names match exactly: `localhost-key.pem` and `localhost.pem`
- Restart the server after adding certificates
