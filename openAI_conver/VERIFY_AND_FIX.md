# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Verify mkcert CA is Installed

The certificates exist, but if you're still seeing the warning, **mkcert -install was not run** or the browser doesn't trust the local CA.

## Critical Step: Install the Local CA

Run this command **as Administrator**:

```powershell
mkcert -install
```

This installs mkcert's root certificate into your system's trust store so browsers will trust certificates generated by mkcert.

## Complete Fix Steps:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator** (Right-click → Run as Administrator)

2. **Install the local CA:**
   ```powershell
   mkcert -install
   ```
   You should see: `The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ✅`

3. **Verify certificates exist:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\10X Dashboard\openAI_conver\certificates"
   dir *.pem
   ```
   You should see `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem`

4. **Restart your server completely** (stop and start again)

5. **Clear browser cache or use incognito/private window**

6. **Access** `https://95.216.225.37:5000`

## If Still Not Working:

1. Make sure you ran `mkcert -install` as Administrator
2. Restart your browser completely (close all windows)
3. Check server console - it should say: `✅ Using valid SSL certificates from certificates/ directory (no browser warning!)`
4. Try accessing in a different browser or incognito mode
5. Check Windows certificate store: Press Win+R, type `certmgr.msc`, go to Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates, look for "mkcert"

## Verify Server is Using Certificates:

When you start the server, check the console output. You should see:
```
✅ Using valid SSL certificates from certificates/ directory (no browser warning!)
```

If you see:
```
⚠️  Using self-signed certificate - browser will show security warning
```
Then the server is not finding the certificates. Make sure they're in the right location.
